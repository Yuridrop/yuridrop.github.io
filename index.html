            <p>Yuridrop provides its users with open source software for
            <br>ethical hacking, game mod-menu's, custom API's for programs
            <br>and more! Whilst these tools are created by us, they are
            <br>intended for genuine ethical use and we take no responsibility
            <br>for any action that is done using them by its user!
            <br>
            <br>The website is currently under very early development and so
            <br>there is not much content or design, we are very sorry for this,
            <br>but in the future there will be a lot more interactive content!
